...do something here...s should be :What\'s the easiest way to do this?The .title() method of a string (either ASCII or Unicode is fine) does this:However, look out for strings with embedded apostrophes, as noted in the docs.The algorithm uses a simple language-independent definition of a word as groups of consecutive letters. The definition works in many contexts but it means that apostrophes in contractions and possessives form word boundaries, which may not be the desired result:the \'title\' method can\'t work well, Try string.capwords, From the python docs on capwords:Split the argument into words using str.split(), capitalize each word using str.capitalize(), and join the capitalized words using str.join(). If the optional second argument sep is absent or None, runs of whitespace characters are replaced by a single space and leading and trailing whitespace are removed, otherwise sep is used to split and join the words.Just because this sort of thing is fun for me, here are two more solutions.Split into words, initial-cap each word from the split groups, and rejoin.  This will change the white space separating the words into a single white space, no matter what it was.EDIT: I don\'t remember what I was thinking back when I wrote the above code, but there is no need to build an explicit list; we can use a generator expression to do it in lazy fashion.  So here is a better solution:Use a regular expression to match the beginning of the string, or white space separating words, plus a single non-whitespace character; use parentheses to mark "match groups".  Write a function that takes a match object, and returns the white space match group unchanged and the non-whitespace character match group in upper case.  Then use re.sub() to replace the patterns.  This one does not have the punctuation problems of the first solution, nor does it redo the white space like my first solution.  This one produces the best result.I\'m glad I researched this answer.  I had no idea that re.sub() could take a function!  You can do nontrivial processing inside re.sub() to produce the final result!Copy-paste-ready version of @jibberia anwser:Why do you complicate your life with joins and for loops when the solution is simple and safe??Just do this:If str.title() doesn\'t work for you, do the capitalization yourself.One-liner:Clear example:Capitalize words...The simplest solution is to split the sentence into words and capitalize the first letter then join it back together.If you don\'t want to split the input string into words first, and using fancy generators:or without importing itertoolsor you can use regular expressions, from steveha\'s answer These will work for all these inputs:Now, these are some other answers that were posted, and inputs for which they don\'t work as expected if we are using the definition of a word being the start of the sentence or anything after a blank space:using \' \' for the split will fix the second output, but capwords() still won\'t work for the firstBe careful with multiple blank spacesAs Mark pointed out you should use .title():However, if would like to make the first letter uppercase inside a django template, you could use this:or using a variable:An empty string will raise an Error if you access [1:], therefore I would use:to uppercase the first letter only.The suggested method str.title() does not work in all cases.\nFor example:instead of "A B 3c". I think, it is better to do something like this:I really like this answer:Copy-paste-ready version of @jibberia anwser:But some of the lines that I was sending split off some blank \'\' characters that caused errors when trying to do s[1:].  There is probably a better way to do this, but I had to add in a if len(s)>0, as in
