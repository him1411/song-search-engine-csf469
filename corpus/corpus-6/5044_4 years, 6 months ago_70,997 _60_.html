I\'m trying to make a function that will compare multiple variables to an integer and output a string of three letters. I was wondering if there was a way to translate this into Python. So say:which would return a list of Is something like this possible?You misunderstand how boolean expressions work; they don\'t work like an English sentence and guess that you are talking about the same comparison for all names here. You are looking for:x and y are otherwise evaluated on their own (False if 0, True otherwise).You can shorten that to:or better still:using a set to take advantage of the constant-cost membership test (in takes a fixed amount of time whatever the left-hand operand is).When you use or, python sees each side of the operator as separate expressions. The expression x or y == 1 is treated as first a boolean test for x, then if that is False, the expression y == 1 is tested.This is due to operator precedence. The or operator has a lower precedence than the == test, so the latter is evaluated first.However, even if this were not the case, and the expression x or y or z == 1 was actually interpreted as (x or y or z) == 1 instead, this would still not do what you expect it to do. x or y or z would evaluate to the first argument that is \'truthy\', e.g. not False, numeric 0 or empty (see boolean expressions for details on what Python considers false in a boolean context).So for the values x = 2; y = 1; z = 0, x or y or z would resolve to 2, because that is the first true-like value in the arguments. Then 2 == 1 would be False, even though y == 1 would be True.The same would apply to the inverse; testing multiple values against a single variable; x == 1 or 2 or 3 would fail for the same reasons. Use x == 1 or x == 2 or x == 3 or x in {1, 2, 3}.Your problem is more easily addressed with a dictionary structure like:Previous Solution: As stated by Martijn Pieters, the correct, and fastest, format is:The one major issue that does not seem to be addressed is that you want your output list to include each letter after a true if statement. Using only Martijn Pieters\' advice you would now have:Problem: The first if statement would return true, and you would never get to the following elif statement. So your list would simply return:What you want is to have separate if statements so that python will read each statement whether the former were true or false. Such as:This will work, but \'if\' you are comfortable using dictionaries (see what I did there), you can clean this up by making an initial dictionary mapping the numbers to the letters you want, then just using a \'for\' loop:The direct way to write x or y or z == 0 isBut I dont think, you like it. :)\nAnd this way is ugly.The other way (a better) is:BTW lots of ifs could be written as something like thisIf you ARE very very lazy, you can put the values inside an array. Such asYou can also put the numbers and letters in a dictionary and do it, but this is probably a LOT more complicated than simply if statements. That\'s what you get for trying to be extra lazy :)One more thing, your will compile, but not in the way you want it to. When you simply put a variable in an if statement (example)the program will check if the variable is not null. Another way to write the above statement (which makes more sense) is Bool is an inbuilt function in python which basically does the command of verifying a boolean statement (If you don\'t know what that is, it is what you are trying to make in your if statement right now :))Another lazy way I found is :To check if a value is contained within a set of variables you can use the inbuilt modules           itertools and operator.For example:Imports:Declare variables:Create mapping of values (in the order you want to check):Use itertools to allow repetition of the variables:Finally, use the map function to create an iterator:Then, when checking for the values (in the original order), use next():etc...This has an advantage over the lambda x: x in (variables) because operator is an inbuilt module and is faster and more efficient than using lambda which has to create a custom in-place function.Another option for checking if there is a non-zero (or False) value in a list:Equivalent:I think this will handle it better:Output:If you want to use if, else statements following is another solution:Using a list comprehension is OK:The output is:This code may be helpfulSet is the good approach here, because it orders the variables, what seems to be your goal here. {z,y,x} is {0,1,3} whatever the order of the parameters.the letter corresponding to a number is given here by chr(ord(\'c\')+i) , where chr and ord are bridges between characters  and numeric codes.So the whole solution is O(n).All of the excellent answers provided here concentrate on the specific requirement of the original poster and concentrate on the if 1 in {x,y,z} solution put forward by Martijn Pieters.\nWhat they ignore is the broader implication of the question:\nHow do I test one variable against multiple values?\nThe solution provided will not work for partial hits if using strings for example:\nTest if the string "Wild" is in multiple valuesorfor this scenario it\'s easiest to convert to a stringyou can use dictionary to save your values and iterate to check if your inputs contains one of themOne line solution:Or:Don\'t get too much complicated just follow the simplest way.Cheers!
