Is there a way to return a list of all the subdirectories in the current directory in Python?I know you can do this with files, but I need to get the list of directories instead.Do you mean immediate subdirectories, or every directory right down the tree? Either way, you could use os.walk to do this:will yield a tuple for each subdirectory. Ths first entry in the 3-tuple is a directory name, soshould give you all of the subdirectories, recursively.Note that the second entry in the tuple is the list of child directories of the entry in the first position, so you could use this instead, but it\'s not likely to save you much.However, you could use it just to give you the immediate child directories:Or see the other solutions already posted, using os.listdir and os.path.isdir, including those at "How to get all of the immediate subdirectories in Python".You could just use glob.globDon\'t forget the trailing / after the *.If you need a recursive solution that will find all the subdirectories in the subdirectories, use walk as proposed before.If you only need the current directory\'s child directories, combine os.listdir with os.path.isdirI prefer using filter (https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#filter), but this is just a matter of taste.Implemented this using python-os-walk. (http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/code-snippets-source-code/python-os-walk/)Much nicer than the above, because you don\'t need several os.path.join() and you will get the full path directly (if you wish), you can do this in Python 3.5+This will give the complete path to the subdirectory.\nIf you only want the name of the subdirectory use f.name instead of f.pathhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.scandirYou can get the list of subdirectories (and files) in Python 2.7 using os.listdir(path)Thanks for the tips, guys. I ran into an issue with softlinks (infinite recursion) being returned as dirs. Softlinks? We don\'t want no stinkin\' soft links! So...This rendered just the dirs, not softlinks:Since I stumbled upon this problem using Python 3.4 and Windows UNC paths, here\'s a variant for this environment:Pathlib is new in Python 3.4 and makes working with paths under different OSes much easier:\nhttps://docs.python.org/3.4/library/pathlib.htmlBuilding upon Eli Bendersky\'s solution, use the following example:where <your_directory> is the path to the directory you want to traverse.With full path and accounting for path being \'.\', \'..\', \'\\\', \'..\\..\\subfolder\', etcAlthough this question is answered a long time ago. I want to recommend to use the pathlib module since this is a robust way to work on Windows and Unix OS.So to get all paths in a specific directory including subdirectories:etc.This answer didn\'t seem to exist already.Here are a couple of simple functions based on @Blair Conrad\'s example - Python 3.4 introduced the pathlib module into the standard library, which provides an object oriented approach to handle filesystem paths:Pathlib is also available on Python 2.7 via the pathlib2 module on PyPi.use a filter function os.path.isdir over os.listdir()\nsomething like this filter(os.path.isdir,[os.path.join(os.path.abspath(\'PATH\'),p) for p in os.listdir(\'PATH/\')])If you want just the top list folder, please use listdir as walk take too much time.
