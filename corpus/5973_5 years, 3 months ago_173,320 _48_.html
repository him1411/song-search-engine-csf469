Today, I came across the dict method get which, given a key in the dictionary, returns the associated value.For what purpose is this function useful? If I wanted to find a value associated with a key in a dictionary, I can just do dict[key], and it returns the same thing:It allows you to provide a default value if the key is missing:returns default_value (whatever you choose it to be), whereaswould raise a KeyError.  If omitted, default_value is None, such thatreturns None just like would. What is the dict.get() method?As already mentioned the get method contains an additional parameter which indicates the missing value. From the documentationReturn the value for key if key is in the dictionary, else default. If default is not given, it defaults to None, so that this method never raises a KeyError.An example can be Are there speed improvements anywhere?As mentioned here,It seems that all three approaches now exhibit similar performance (within about 10% of each other), more or less independent of the properties of the list of words.Earlier get was considerably slower, However now the speed is almost comparable along with the additional advantage of returning the default value. But to clear all our queries, we can test on a fairly large list (Note that the test includes looking up all the valid keys only)Now timing these two functions using timeitAs we can see the lookup is faster than the get as there is no function lookup. This can be seen through disWhere will it be useful?It will be useful whenever you want to provide a default value whenever you are looking up a dictionary. This reducesTo a single line, val = dic.get(key,def_val)Where will it be NOT useful?Whenever you want to return a KeyError stating that the particular key is not available. Returning a default value also carries the risk that a particular default value may be a key too! Is it possible to have get like feature in dict[\'key\']?Yes! We need to implement the __missing__ in a dict subclass.A sample program can beA small demonstration can beget takes a second optional value.  If the specified key does not exist in your dictionary, then this value will be returned.If you do not give the second parameter, None will be returned.If you use indexing as in dictionary[\'Year\'], nonexistent keys will raise KeyError.The purpose is that you can give a default value if the key is not found, which is very usefulI will give a practical example in scraping web data using python, a lot of the times you will get keys with no values, in those cases you will get errors if you use dictionary[\'key\'], whereas dictionary.get(\'key\', \'return_otherwise\') has no problems.Similarly, I would use \'\'.join(list) as opposed to list[0] if you try to capture a single value from a list.hope it helps.[Edit] Here is a practical example:Say, you are calling an API, which returns a JOSN file you need to parse. The first JSON looks like following:The second JOSN is like this:Note that the second JSON is missing the "submitdate_ts" key, which is pretty normal in any data structure.So when you try to access the value of that key in a loop, can you call it with the following:You could, but it will give you a traceback error for the second JSON line, because the key simply doesn\'t exist.The appropriate way of coding this, could be the following:{\'x\': None} is there to avoid the second level getting an error. Of course you can build in more fault tolerance into the code if you are doing scraping. Like first specifying a if conditionBased on usage should use this get method.Example1Example2For what purpose is this function useful?One particular usage is counting with dictionary. Let\'s assume you want to count a number of occurrences of each element in a given list. The common way to do so is to make a dictionary where keys are elements and values are the number of occurrences.Using the .get() method you can make this code more compact and clear:
