float(\'nan\') results in Nan (not a number). But how do I check for it? Should be very easy, but I cannot find it.math.isnan()Checks if the float x is a NaN (not a number). NaNs are part of the IEEE 754 standards. Operation like but not limited to inf * 0, inf / inf or any operation involving a NaN, e.g. nan * 1, return a NaN.New in version 2.6.The usual way to test for a NaN is to see if it\'s equal to itself:numpy.isnan(number) tells you if it\'s NaN or not in Python 2.5.I actually just ran into this, but for me it was checking for nan, -inf, or inf. I just usedThis is true for numbers, false for nan and both inf, and will raise an exception for things like strings or other types (which is probably a good thing). Also this does not require importing any libraries like math or numpy (numpy is so damn big it doubles the size of any compiled application).math.isnan()or compare the number to itself. NaN is always != NaN, otherwise (e.g. if it is a number) the comparison should succeed.Another method if you\'re stuck on <2.6, you don\'t have numpy, and you don\'t have IEEE 754 support:With python < 2.6 I ended up withThis works for me with python 2.5.1 on a Solaris 5.9 box and with python 2.6.5 on Ubuntu 10 Well I entered this post, because i\'ve had some issues with the function:There are problem when you run this code:It raises exception.\nMy solution for that is to make another check:I am receiving the data from a web-service that sends NaN as a string \'Nan\'. But there could be other sorts of string in my data as well, so a simple float(value) could throw an exception. I used the following variant of the accepted answer:Requirement:All the methods to tell if the variable is NaN or None:None typeNaN typehere is an answer working with:Here it is:And some examples:Output:
