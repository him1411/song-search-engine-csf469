This is what I have:but I want to search the subfolders of src. Something like this would work:But this is obviously limited and clunky.Python 3.5+Starting with Python version 3.5, the glob module supports the "**" directive (which is parsed only if you pass recursive flag):If you need a list, just use glob.glob instead of glob.iglob.Python 2.2 to 3.4For older Python versions, starting with Python 2.2, use os.walk to recursively walk a directory and fnmatch.filter to match against a simple expression:Python 2.1 and earlierFor even older Python versions, use glob.glob against each filename instead of fnmatch.filter.Similar to other solutions, but using fnmatch.fnmatch instead of glob, since os.walk already listed the filenames:Also, using a generator alows you to process each file as it is found, instead of finding all the files and then processing them.I\'ve modified the glob module to support ** for recursive globbing, e.g:https://github.com/miracle2k/python-glob2/Useful when you want to provide your users with the ability to use the ** syntax, and thus  os.walk() alone is not good enough.Starting with Python 3.4, one can use the glob() method of one of the Path classes in the new pathlib module, which supports ** wildcards. For example:Update:\nStarting with Python 3.5, the same syntax is also supported by glob.glob().fnmatch gives you exactly the same patterns as glob, so this is really an excellent replacement for glob.glob with very close semantics.  An iterative version (e.g. a generator), IOW a replacement for glob.iglob, is a trivial adaptation (just yield the intermediate results as you go, instead of extending a single results list to return at the end).You\'ll want to use os.walk to collect filenames that match your criteria. For example:Here\'s a solution with nested list comprehensions, os.walk and simple suffix matching instead of glob:It can be compressed to a one-liner:or generalized as a function:If you do need full glob style patterns, you can follow Alex\'s and\nBruno\'s example and use fnmatch:Johan and Bruno provide excellent solutions on the minimal requirement as stated. I have just released Formic which implements Ant FileSet and Globs which can handle this and more complicated scenarios. An implementation of your requirement is:based on other answers this is my current working implementation, which retrieves nested xml files in a root directory:I\'m really having fun with python :)Recently I had to recover my pictures with the extension .jpg. I ran photorec and recovered 4579 directories 2.2 million files within, having tremendous variety of extensions.With the script below I was able to select 50133 files havin .jpg extension within minutes:Another way to do it using just the glob module. Just seed the rglob method with a starting base directory and a pattern to match and it will return a list of matching file names.In addition to the suggested answers, you can do this with some lazy generation and list comprehension magic:Besides fitting in one line and avoiding unnecessary lists in memory, this also has the nice side effect, that you can use it in a way similar to the ** operator, e.g., you could use os.path.join(root, \'some/path/*.c\') in order to get all .c files in all sub directories of src that have this structure.Simplified version of Johan Dahlin\'s answer, without fnmatch.Or with a list comprehension:Just made this.. it will print files and directory in hierarchical wayBut I didn\'t used fnmatch or walkThat one uses fnmatch or regular expression:Here is my solution using list comprehension to search for multiple file extensions recursively in a directory and all subdirectories:I modified the top answer in this posting.. and recently created this script which will loop through all files in a given directory (searchdir) and the sub-directories under it... and prints filename, rootdir, modified/creation date, and size.Hope this helps someone... and they can walk the directory and get fileinfo.Here is a solution that will match the pattern against the full path and not just the base filename.It uses fnmatch.translate to convert a glob-style pattern into a regular expression, which is then matched against the full path of each file found while walking the directory.re.IGNORECASE is optional, but desirable on Windows since the file system itself is not case-sensitive. (I didn\'t bother compiling the regex because docs indicate it should be cached internally.)I needed a solution for python 2.x that works fast on large directories.\nI endet up with this:Note that you might need some exception handling in case ls doesn\'t find any matching file.
