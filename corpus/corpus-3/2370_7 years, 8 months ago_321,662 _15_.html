I am writing a Python script in Windows. I want to do something based on the file size. For example, if the size is greater than 0, I will send an email to somebody, otherwise continue to other things. How do I check the file size?Use os.stat, and use the st_size member of the resulting object:Output is in bytes.Like this (credit http://www.daniweb.com/forums/thread78629.html):The other answers work for real files, but if you need something that works for "file-like objects", try this:It works for real files and StringIO\'s, in my limited testing. (Python 2.7.3.) The "file-like object" API isn\'t really a rigorous interface, of course, but the API documentation suggests that file-like objects should support seek() and tell().EditAnother difference between this and os.stat() is that you can stat() a file even if you don\'t have permission to read it. Obviously the seek/tell approach won\'t work unless you have read permission.Edit 2 At Jonathon\'s suggestion, here\'s a paranoid version. (The version above leaves the file pointer at the end of the file, so if you were to try to read from the file, you\'d get zero bytes back!)Result:Using pathlib (added in Python 3.4 and available on PyPI)...This is really only an interface around os.stat, but using pathlib provides an easy way to access other file related operations.Strictly sticking to the question, the python code (+ pseudo-code) would be:
