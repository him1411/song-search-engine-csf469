I would like to know how to I exit from Python without having an traceback dump on the output. I still want want to be able to return an error code but I do not want to display the traceback log.I want to be able to exit using exit(number) without trace but in case of an Exception (not an exit) I want the trace.You are presumably encountering an exception and the program is exiting because of this (with a traceback).  The first thing to do therefore is to catch that exception, before exiting cleanly (maybe with a message, example given).Try something like this in your main routine:Perhaps you\'re trying to catch all exceptions and this is catching the SystemExit exception raised by sys.exit()?In general, using except: without naming an exception is a bad idea. You\'ll catch all kinds of stuff you don\'t want to catch -- like SystemExit -- and it can also mask your own programming errors. My example above is silly, unless you\'re doing something in terms of cleanup. You could replace it with:If you need to exit without raising SystemExit:I do this, in code that runs under unittest and calls fork(). Unittest gets when the forked process raises SystemExit. This is definitely a corner case!something like import sys; sys.exit(0) ?It\'s much better practise to avoid using sys.exit() and instead raise/handle exceptions to allow the program to finish cleanly.  If you want to turn off traceback, simply use:You can set this at the top of your script to squash all traceback output, but I prefer to use it more sparingly, for example "known errors" where I want the output to be clean, e.g. in the file foo.py:If CalledProcessError is caught, the output will look like this:If any other error occurs, we still get the full traceback output.Use the built-in python function quit() and that\'s it.\nNo need to import any library.\nI\'m using python 3.4I would do it this way:
