Is there any way to make pip play well with multiple versions of Python? For example, I want to use pip to explicitly install things to either my site 2.5 installation or my site 2.6 installation.For example, with easy_install, I use easy_install-2.{5,6}.And, yes \xe2\x80\x94 I know about virtualenv, and no \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s not a solution to this particular problem.Since version 0.8, Pip supports pip-{version}. You can use it the same as easy_install-{version}:EDIT: pip changed its schema to use pipVERSION instead of pip-VERSION in version 1.5. You should use the following if you have pip >= 1.5:Check https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/1053 for more detailsReferences:/path/to/python2.{5,6} /path/to/pip install PackageName doesn\'t work?For this to work on any python version that doesn\'t have pip already installed you need to download pip and do python*version* setup.py install. For example python3.3 setup.py install. This resolves the import error in the comments.  (As suggested by @hbdgaf)I had python 2.6 installed by default (Amazon EC2 AMI), but needed python2.7 plus some external packages for my application. Assuming you already installed python2.7 alongside with default python (2.6 in my case). Here is how to install pip and packages for non-default python2.7Install pip for your python version:Use specific pip version to install packages:In Windows, you can execute the pip module by mentioning the python version ( You need to ensure that the launcher is on your path )py -3.4 -m pip install pyfora py -2.7 -m pip install pyforaAlternatively, you can call the desired python executable directly like this:/path/to/python.exe -m pip install pyforaIt worked for me in windows this way:I changed the name of python files python.py and pythonw.exe to python3.py pythonw3.py Then I just ran this command in the prompt:python3 -m pip install packageOther answers show how to use pip with both 2.X and 3.X Python, but does not show how to handle the case of multiple Python distributions (eg. original Python and Anaconda Python).I have a total of 3 Python versions: original Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 and Anaconda Python 3.5.Here is how I install a package into:Original Python 3.5:Original Python 2.7:Anaconda Python 3.5:orSimpler, as Anaconda overrides original Python binaries in user environment.Of course, installing in anaconda should be done with conda command, this is just an example.Also, make sure that pip is installed for that specific python.You might need to manually install pip. This works in Ubuntu 16.04:orSo apparently there are multiple versions of easy_install and pip. It seems to be a big mess. Anyway, this is what I did to install Django for Python 2.7 on Ubuntu 12.10:I ran into this issue myself recently and found that I wasn\'t getting the right pip for Python 3, on my Linux system that also has Python 2.First you must ensure that you have installed pip for your python version:For Python 2:For Python 3:Then to install packages for one version of Python or the other, simply use the following for Python 2:or for Python 3:pip is also a python package. So the easiest way to install modules to a specific python version would be belowor From here: https://docs.python.org/3/installing/Here is how to install packages for various versions that are installed at the same time linux, mac, posix:On Windows, use the py Python launcher in combination with the -m switch:Context: Archlinux  Action:\nInstall python2-pip:\nsudo pacman -S python2-pip You now have pip2.7:\nsudo pip2.7 install botoTest (in my case I needed \'boto\'):\nRun the following commands:  Success: No error.Exit: Ctrl+D for example, if you set other versions (e.g. 3.5) as default and want to install pip for python 2.7:
