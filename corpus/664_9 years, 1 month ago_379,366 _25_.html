What is the best way to go about calling a function given a string with the function\'s name in a Python program.  For example, let\'s say that I have a module foo, and I have a string whose contents are "bar". What is the best way to go about calling foo.bar()?I need to get the return value of the function, which is why I don\'t just use eval. I figured out how to do it by using eval to define a temp function that returns the result of that function call, but I\'m hoping that there is a more elegant way to do this.Assuming module foo with method bar:As far as that goes, lines 2 and 3 can be compressed to:if that makes more sense for your use case.  You can use getattr in this fashion on class instance bound methods, module-level methods, class methods... the list goes on.orlocals returns a dictionary with a current local symbol table. globals returns a dictionary with global symbol table.Patrick\'s solution is probably the cleanest.\nIf you need to dynamically pick up the module as well, you can import it like:Just a simple contribution. If the class that we need to instance is in the same file, we can use something like this:For example:And, if not a class:Given a string, with a complete python path to a function, this is how I went about getting the result of said function:The answer (I hope) no one ever wantedEval like behaviorWhy not add auto-importingIn case we have extra dictionaries we want to checkWe need to go deeperFor what it\'s worth, if you needed to pass the function (or class) name and app name as a string, then you could do this:none of what was suggested helped me. I did discover this though.I am using python 2.66 Hope this helpsThe best answer according to the Python programming FAQ would be:The primary advantage of this technique is that the strings do not need to match the names of the functions. This is also the primary technique used to emulate a case constructTry this. While this still uses eval, it only uses it to summon the function from the current context. Then, you have the real function to use as you wish.The main benefit for me from this is that you will get any eval-related errors at the point of summoning the function. Then you will get only the function-related errors when you call.
