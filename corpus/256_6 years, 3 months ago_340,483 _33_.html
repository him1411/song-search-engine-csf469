I know that I can do:I can also do this:But if I want to do the same thing inside two different exceptions, the best I can think of right now is to do this:Is there any way that I can do something like this (since the action to take in both exceptions is to say please):Now this really won\'t work, as it matches the syntax for:So, my effort to catch the two distinct exceptions doesn\'t exactly come through.Is there a way to do this?From Python Documentation:An except clause may name multiple exceptions as a parenthesized tuple, for exampleSeparating the exception from the variable with a comma will still work in Python 2.6 and 2.7, but is now deprecated and does not work in Python 3; now you should be using as.How do I catch multiple exceptions in one line (except block)Do this:The parentheses are required due to older syntax that used the commas to assign the error object to a name. The as keyword is used for the assignment. You can use any name for the error object, I prefer error personally.To do this in a manner currently and forward compatible with Python, you need to separate the Exceptions with commas and wrap them with parentheses to differentiate from earlier syntax that assigned the exception instance to a variable name by following the Exception type to be caught with a comma. Here\'s an example of simple usage: I\'m currently wrapping the main in my interactive command-line PythonTrainer program with a catch for KeyboardInterrupt and EOFError so that the user can leave an interactive keyboard input session semi-gracefully with Ctrl+D or Ctrl+C:I\'m specifying only these exceptions to avoid hiding bugs, which if I encounter I expect the full stack trace from.This is documented here: https://docs.python.org/tutorial/errors.htmlYou can assign the exception to a variable, (e is common, but you might prefer a more verbose variable if you have long exception handling or your IDE only highlights selections larger than that, as mine does.) The instance has an args attribute. Here is an example:Note that in Python 3, the err object falls out of scope when the except block is concluded.You may see code that assigns the error with a comma. This usage, the only form available in Python 2.5 and earlier, is deprecated, and if you wish your code to be forward compatible in Python 3, you should update the syntax to use the new form:If you see the comma name assignment in your codebase, and you\'re using Python 2.5 or higher, switch to the new way of doing it so your code remains compatible when you upgrade.For python 2.5 and earlier versions, the correct syntax is:Where e is the Exception instance.From Python documentation -> 8.3 Handling Exceptions:A try statement may have more than one except clause, to specify\n  handlers for different exceptions. At most one handler will be\n  executed. Handlers only handle exceptions that occur in the\n  corresponding try clause, not in other handlers of the same try\n  statement. An except clause may name multiple exceptions as a\n  parenthesized tuple, for example:Note that the parentheses around this tuple are required, because\n  except ValueError, e: was the syntax used for what is normally\n  written as except ValueError as e: in modern Python (described\n  below). The old syntax is still supported for backwards compatibility.\n  This means except RuntimeError, TypeError is not equivalent to\n  except (RuntimeError, TypeError): but to except RuntimeError as\n  TypeError: which is not what you want.One of the way to do this is..and another way is to create method which performs task executed by except block and call it through all of the except block that you write..I know that second one is not the best way to do this, but i\'m just showing number of ways to do this thing.If you frequently use a large number of exceptions, you can pre-define a tuple, so you don\'t have to re-type them many times. NOTES: If you, also, need to catch other exceptions than those in the\npre-defined tuple, you will need to define another except block.  If you just cannot tolerate a global variable, define it in main()\nand pass it around where needed...
