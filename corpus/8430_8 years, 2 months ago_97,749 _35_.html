touch is a Unix utility that sets the modification and access times of files to the current time of day.  If the file doesn\'t exist, it is created with default permissions.How would you implement it as a Python function? Try to be cross platform and complete.(Current Google results for "python touch file" are not that great, but point to os.utime.)This tries to be a little more race-free than the other solutions.  (The with keyword is new in Python 2.5.)Roughly equivalent to this.Now, to really make it race-free, you need to use futimes and change the timestamp of the open filehandle, instead of opening the file and then changing the timestamp on the filename (which may have been renamed).  Unfortunately, Python doesn\'t seem to provide a way to call futimes without going through ctypes or similar...EDITAs noted by Nate Parsons, Python 3.3 will add specifying a file descriptor (when os.supports_fd) to functions such as os.utime, which will use the futimes syscall instead of the utimes syscall under the hood.  In other words:Looks like this is new as of Python 3.4 - pathlib.This will create a file.txt at the path.--Path.touch(mode=0o777, exist_ok=True)Create a file at this given path. If mode is given, it is combined with the process\xe2\x80\x99 umask value to determine the file mode and access flags. If the file already exists, the function succeeds if exist_ok is true (and its modification time is updated to the current time), otherwise FileExistsError is raised.  Why not try this?:I believe this eliminates any race condition that matters.  If the file does not exist then an exception will be thrown.The only possible race condition here is if the file is created before open() is called but after os.utime().  But this does not matter because in this case the modification time will be as expected since it must have happened during the call to touch().Here\'s some code that uses ctypes (only tested on Linux):Simplistic:Theoretically, it\'s possible someone will delete the file after the open, causing utime to raise an exception. But arguably that\'s OK, since something bad did happen.This answer is compatible with all versions since Python-2.5 when keyword with has been released.1. Set current time, Create file if does not exist (exactly same as command touch)A more robust version:2. Just create the file if does not exist (does not update time) 3. Just update file access/modified times (does not create file if not existing)Using os.path.exists() does not simplify the code:Bonus: Update time of all files in a directoryComplex (possibly buggy):This tries to also allow setting the access or modification time, like GNU touch.It might seem logical to create a string with the desired variables, and pass it to os.system:This is inadequate in a number of ways (e.g.,it doesn\'t handle whitespace), so don\'t do it.  A more robust method is to use subprocess :subprocess.call([\'touch\', os.path.join(dirname, fileName)])While this is much better than using a subshell (with os.system), it is still only suitable for quick-and-dirty scripts; use the accepted answer for cross-platform programs."open(file_name, \'a\').close()"  did not work for me in Python 2.7 on Windows.  "os.utime(file_name, None)" worked just fine.Also, I had a need to recursively touch all files in a directory with a date older than some date.  I created hte following based on ephemient\'s very helpful response.
