For comparing object identities, you can use the keyword is and its negation is not.e.g.Not equal  !=  (vs equal ==)Are you asking about something like this?This Python - Basic Operators chart might be helpful.There\'s the != (not equal) operator that returns True when two values differ, though be careful with the types cause "1" != 1 this will always return True and "1" == 1 will always return False, since the types differ, python is dynamically but strongly typed, other statically typed languages would complain about comparing different types.Theres also the else clause The is operator is the object identity operator used to check if two object in fact are the same:Seeing as everyone else has already listed most of the other ways to say not equal I will just add:in this case it is simple switching the check of positive == (true) to negative and vise versa...You can use both != or <>.However, note that != is preferred where <> is deprecated.Use != or <>. Both stands for not equal.The comparison operators <> and != are alternate spellings of the same operator. != is the preferred spelling; <> is obsolescent.
