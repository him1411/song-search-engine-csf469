How can I raise an exception in Python so that it can later be caught via an except block?Use the most specific Exception constructor that semantically fits your issue.  Be specific in your message, e.g.:Avoid raising a generic Exception, to catch it, you\'ll have to catch all other more specific exceptions that subclass it.For example:and more specific catches won\'t catch the general exception:Instead, use the most specific Exception constructor that semantically fits your issue.which also handily allows an arbitrary number of arguments to be passed to the constructor. This works in Python 2 and 3.These arguments are accessed by the args attribute on the Exception object. For example:prints In Python 2.5, an actual message attribute was added to BaseException in favor of encouraging users to subclass Exceptions and stop using args, but the introduction of message and the original deprecation of args has been retracted.When inside an except clause, you might want to, e.g. log that a specific type of error happened, and then reraise. The best way to do this while preserving the stack trace is to use a bare raise statement, e.g.:You can preserve the stacktrace (and error value) with sys.exc_info(), but this is way more error prone and has compatibility problems between Python 2 and 3, prefer to use a bare raise to reraise. To explain - the sys.exc_info() returns the type, value, and traceback. This is the syntax in Python 2 - note this is not compatible with Python 3:If you want to, you can modify what happens with your new raise - e.g. setting new args for the instance:And we have preserved the whole traceback while modifying the args. Note that this is not a best practice and it is invalid syntax in Python 3 (making keeping compatibility much harder to work around).In Python 3:Again: avoid manually manipulating tracebacks. It\'s less efficient and more error prone. And if you\'re using threading and sys.exc_info you may even get the wrong traceback (especially if you\'re using exception handling for control flow - which I\'d personally tend to avoid.)In Python 3, you can chain Exceptions, which preserve tracebacks:Be aware:These can easily hide and even get into production code. You want to raise an exception/error, and doing them will raise an error, but not the one intended!Valid in Python 2, but not in Python 3 is the following:Only valid in much older versions of Python (2.4 and lower), you may still see people raising strings:In all modern versions, this will actually raise a TypeError, because you\'re not raising a BaseException type. If you\'re not checking for the right exception and don\'t have a reviewer that\'s aware of the issue, it could get into production.I raise Exceptions to warn consumers of my API if they\'re using it incorrectly:"I want to make an error on purpose, so that it would go into the except"You can create your own error types, if you want to indicate something specific is wrong with your application, just subclass the appropriate point in the exception hierarchy:and usage:DON\'T DO THIS. Raising a bare Exception is absolutely not the right thing to do; see Aaron Hall\'s excellent answer instead.Can\'t get much more pythonic than this:See the raise statement docs for python if you\'d like more info.For the common case where you need to throw an exception in response to some unexpected conditions, and that you never intend to catch, but simply to fail fast to enable you to debug from there if it ever happens \xe2\x80\x94 the most logical one seems to be AssertionError:In Python3 there are 4 different syntaxes for rasing exceptions: 1. raise exception vs. 2. raise exception (args)If you use raise exception (args)  to raise an exception then the   args will be printed when you print the exception object - as shown in the example below. 3.raiseraise statement without any arguments re-raises the last exception. \nThis is useful if you need to perform some actions after catching the exception and  then want to re-raise it. But if there was no exception before, raise statement raises  TypeError Exception. 4. raise exception (args) from original_exceptionThis statement is used to create exception chaining in which an exception that is raised in response to another exception can contain the details of the original exception - as shown in the example below.Output:Read the existing answers first, this is just an addendum.Notice that you can raise exceptions with or without arguments.Example:exits the program but you might want to know what happened.So you can use this.this will print "program exited" before closing the program.
