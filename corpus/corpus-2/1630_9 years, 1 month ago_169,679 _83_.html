For a person without a comp-sci background, what is a lambda in the world of Computer Science?Lambda comes from the Lambda Calculus and refers to anonymous functions in programming.Why is this cool? It allows you to write quick throw away functions without naming them. It also provides a nice way to write closures. With that power you can do things like this.PythonAs you can see from the snippet of Python, the function adder takes in an argument x, and returns an anonymous function, or lambda, that takes another argument y. That anonymous function allows you to create functions from functions. This is a simple example, but it should convey the power lambdas and closures have.Examples in other languagesJavaScriptJavaScript (ES6)SchemeC# 3.5 or higherSwiftPHP\nHaskellJavaSee this postLuaA lambda is a type of function, defined inline. Along with a lambda you also usually have some kind of variable type that can hold a reference to a function, lambda or otherwise.For instance, here\'s a C# piece of code that doesn\'t use a lambda:This calls Calculator, passing along not just two numbers, but which method to call inside Calculator to obtain the results of the calculation.In C# 2.0 we got anonymous methods, which shortens the above code to:And then in C# 3.0 we got lambdas which makes the code even shorter:It refers to the lambda calculus which is a formal system that just has lambda expressions, which represents a function that takes a function for its sole argument and returns a function. All functions in the lambda calculus are of that type, i.e., \xce\xbb : \xce\xbb \xe2\x86\x92 \xce\xbb.Lisp used the lambda concept to name its anonymous function literals. This lambda represents a function that takes two arguments, x and y, and returns their product:It can be applied in-line like this (evaluates to 50):The name "lambda" is just a historical artifact. All we\'re talking about is an expression whose value is a function.A simple example (using Scala for the next line) is:where the argument to the foreach method is an expression for an anonymous function. The above line is more or less the same as writing something like this (not quite real code, but you\'ll get the idea):except that you don\'t need to bother with:Once you\'re used to function values, having to do without them seems as silly as being required to name every expression, such as:instead of just writing the expression where you need it:The exact notation varies from language to language; Greek isn\'t always required!  ;-)The lambda calculus is a consistent mathematical theory of substitution. In school mathematics one sees for example x+y=5 paired with x\xe2\x88\x92y=1. Along with ways to manipulate individual equations it\'s also possible to put the information from these two together, provided cross-equation substitutions are done logically. Lambda calculus codifies the correct way to do these substitutions.Given that y = x\xe2\x88\x921 is a valid rearrangement of the second equation, this: \xce\xbb y = x\xe2\x88\x921 means a function substituting the symbols x\xe2\x88\x921 for the symbol y. Now imagine applying \xce\xbb y to each term in the first equation. If a term is y then perform the substitution; otherwise do nothing. If you do this out on paper you\'ll see how applying that \xce\xbb y will make the first equation solvable.That\'s an answer without any computer science or programming.The simplest programming example I can think of comes from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_(programming_language)#How_it_works:here is how the square function might be defined in an imperative\n  programming language (C):The variable x is a formal parameter which is replaced by the actual\n  value to be squared when the function is called. In a functional\n  language (Scheme) the same function would be defined:This is different in many ways, but it still uses the formal parameter\n  x in the same way.Added: http://imgur.com/a/XBHubSlightly oversimplified: a lambda function is one that can be passed round to other functions and it\'s logic accessed.In C# lambda syntax is often compiled to simple methods in the same way as anonymous delegates, but it can also be broken down and its logic read.For instance (in C#3):LinqToSql can read that function (x > 15) and convert it to the actual SQL to execute using expression trees.The statement above becomes:This is different from normal methods or anonymous delegates (which are just compiler magic really) because they cannot be read.Not all methods in C# that use lambda syntax can be compiled to expression trees (i.e. actual lambda functions). For instance:Now the expression tree cannot be read - SomeComplexCheck cannot be broken down. The SQL statement will execute without the where, and every row in the data will be put through SomeComplexCheck.Lambda functions should not be confused with anonymous methods. For instance:This also has an \'inline\' function, but this time it\'s just compiler magic - the C# compiler will split this out to a new instance method with an autogenerated name. Anonymous methods can\'t be read, and so the logic can\'t be translated out as it can for lambda functions.I like the explanation of Lambdas in this article: The Evolution Of LINQ And Its Impact On The Design Of C#. It made a lot of sense to me as it shows a real world for Lambdas and builds it out as a practical example.Their quick explanation: Lambdas are a way to treat code (functions) as data.An example of a lambda in Ruby is as follows:Will genereate the following output:@Brian I use lambdas all the time in C#, in LINQ and non-LINQ operators. Example:Before C#, I used anonymous functions in JavaScript for callbacks to AJAX functions, before the term Ajax was even coined:The interesting thing with C#\'s lambda syntax, though, is that on their own their type cannot be infered (i.e., you can\'t type var foo = (x,y) => x * y) but depending on which type they\'re assigned to, they\'ll be compiled as delegates or abstract syntax trees representing the expression (which is how LINQ object mappers do their "language-integrated" magic).Lambdas in LISP can also be passed to a quotation operator and then traversed as a list of lists. Some powerful macros are made this way. You can think of it as an anonymous function - here\'s some more info: Wikipedia - Anonymous FunctionThe question is formally answered greatly, so I will not try to add more on this.In very simple, informal words to someone that knows very little or nothing on math or programming, I would explain it as a small "machine" or "box" that takes some input, makes some work and produces some output, has no particular name, but we know where it is and by just this knowledge, we use it.Practically speaking, for a person that knows what a function is, I would tell them that it is a function that has no name, usually put to a point in memory that can be used just by referencing to that memory (usually via the usage of a variable - if they have heard about the concept of the function pointers, I would use them as a similar concept) - this answer covers the pretty basics (no mention of closures etc) but one can get the point easily.I have trouble wrapping my head around lambda expressions because I work in Visual FoxPro, which has Macro substitution and the ExecScript{} and Evaluate() functions, which seem to serve much the same purpose.One definite benefit to using formal lambdas is (I assume) compile-time checking: Fox won\'t know if you typo the text string above until it tries to run it.This is also useful for data-driven code: you can store entire routines in memo fields in the database and then just evaluate them at run-time. This lets you tweak part of the application without actually having access to the source. (But that\'s another topic altogether.)Just because I cant see a C++11 example here, I\'ll go ahead and post this nice example from here. After searching, it is the clearest languge specific example rhat I could find.It is a function that has no name. For e.g. in c# you can useto return the numbers that are greater than 5.is the lambda part here. It represents a function which takes a parameter (number) and returns a boolean value (number > 5). GetMatchingItems method uses this lambda on all the items in the collection and returns the matching items.I got it too. I`ve tried it in JS with this one:It adds 2 to 4 then mults the result by 6. However I find it sometimes hard to read :(Also I`ve made an interesting forEach function:forEach([1,2,3,4,5])(console.log);This method will iterate an array and performs an action - in the case printing to the console. Now I too get why labmdas are powerful.In Javascript, for example, functions are treated as the same mixed type as everything else (int, string, float, bool). As such, you can create functions on the fly, assign them to things, and call them back later. It\'s useful but, not something you want to over use or you\'ll confuse everyone who has to maintain your code after you...This is some code I was playing with to see how deep this rabbit hole goes:In context of CS a lambda function is an abstract mathematical concept that tackles a problem of symbolic evaluation of mathematical expressions. In that context a lambda function is the same as a lambda term.But in programming languages it\'s something different. It\'s a piece of code that is declared "in place", and that can be passed around as a "first-class citizen". This concept appeared to be useful so that it came into almost all popular modern programming languages (see lambda functions everwhere post).In computer programming, lambda is a piece of code (statement, expression or a group of them) which takes some arguments from an external source. It must not always be an anonymous function - we have many ways to implement them.We have clear separation between expressions, statements and functions, which mathematicians do not have.The word "function" in programming is also different - we have "function is a series of steps to do" (from Latin "perform"). In math it is something about correlation between variables.Functional languages are trying to be as similar to math formulas as possible, and their words mean almost the same. But in other programming languages we have it different.
