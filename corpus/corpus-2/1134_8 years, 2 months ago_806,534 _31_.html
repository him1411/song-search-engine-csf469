How can I check what version of the Python Interpreter is interpreting my script?This information is available in the sys.version string in the sys module:Human readable:For further processing:To ensure a script runs with a minimal version requirement of the Python interpreter add this to your code:This compares major and minor version information. Add micro (=0, 1, etc) and even releaselevel (=\'alpha\',\'final\', etc) to the tuple as you like. Note however, that it is almost always better to "duck" check if a certain feature is there, and if not, workaround (or bail out). Sometimes features go away in newer releases, being replaced by others.From the command line (note the capital \'V\'):This is documented in \'man python\'.I like sys.hexversion for stuff like this.http://docs.python.org/library/sys.html#sys.hexversionYour best bet is probably something like so: Additionally, you can always wrap your imports in a simple try, which should catch syntax errors. And, to @Heikki\'s point, this code will be compatible with much older versions of python: Put something like:at the top of your script.Note that depending on what else is in your script, older versions of python than the target may not be able to even load the script, so won\'t get far enough to report this error. As a workaround, you can run the above in a script that imports the script with the more modern code.I found this method somewhere.Here\'s a short commandline version which exits straight away (handy for scripts and automated execution):Or just the major, minor and micro:Like Seth said, the main script could check sys.version_info (but note that that didn\'t appear until 2.0, so if you want to support older versions you would need to check another version property of the sys module).But you still need to take care of not using any Python language features in the file that are not available in older Python versions. For example, this is allowed in Python 2.5 and later:but won\'t work in older Python versions, because you could only have except OR finally match the try. So for compatibility with older Python versions you need to write:sys.version gives you what you want, just pick the first number :)To see a MSDOS script to check the version before running the Python interpreter (to avoid Python version syntax exceptions) See solution:How can I check for Python version in a program that uses new language features?and MS script; Python version check prelaunch of Python module\nhttp://pastebin.com/aAuJ91FQ\n(script likely easy to convert to other OS scripts.)Just type python in your terminal and you can see the the version \n as like following if you are working on linux just give command "python"  output will be like this**Python 2.4.3 (#1, Jun 11 2009, 14:09:37)[GCC 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-44)] on linux2Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.**
