What are metaclasses? What do you use them for?A metaclass is the class of a class. Like a class defines how an instance of the class behaves, a metaclass defines how a class behaves. A class is an instance of a metaclass.While in Python you can use arbitrary callables for metaclasses (like Jerub shows), the more useful approach is actually to make it an actual class itself. type is the usual metaclass in Python. In case you\'re wondering, yes, type is itself a class, and it is its own type. You won\'t be able to recreate something like type purely in Python, but Python cheats a little. To create your own metaclass in Python you really just want to subclass type.A metaclass is most commonly used as a class-factory. Like you create an instance of the class by calling the class, Python creates a new class (when it executes the \'class\' statement) by calling the metaclass. Combined with the normal __init__ and __new__ methods, metaclasses therefore allow you to do \'extra things\' when creating a class, like registering the new class with some registry, or even replace the class with something else entirely.When the class statement is executed, Python first executes the body of the class statement as a normal block of code. The resulting namespace (a dict) holds the attributes of the class-to-be. The metaclass is determined by looking at the baseclasses of the class-to-be (metaclasses are inherited), at the __metaclass__ attribute of the class-to-be (if any) or the __metaclass__ global variable. The metaclass is then called with the name, bases and attributes of the class to instantiate it.However, metaclasses actually define the type of a class, not just a factory for it, so you can do much more with them. You can, for instance, define normal methods on the metaclass. These metaclass-methods are like classmethods, in that they can be called on the class without an instance, but they are also not like classmethods in that they cannot be called on an instance of the class. type.__subclasses__() is an example of a method on the type metaclass. You can also define the normal \'magic\' methods, like __add__, __iter__ and __getattr__, to implement or change how the class behaves.Here\'s an aggregated example of the bits and pieces:Before understanding metaclasses, you need to master classes in Python. And Python has a very peculiar idea of what classes are, borrowed from the Smalltalk language.In most languages, classes are just pieces of code that describe how to produce an object. That\'s kinda true in Python too:But classes are more than that in Python. Classes are objects too.Yes, objects. As soon as you use the keyword class, Python executes it and creates\nan OBJECT. The instructioncreates in memory an object with the name "ObjectCreator". This object (the class) is itself capable of creating objects (the instances), \nand this is why it\'s a class. But still, it\'s an object, and therefore:e.g.:Since classes are objects, you can create them on the fly, like any object.First, you can create a class in a function using class:But it\'s not so dynamic, since you still have to write the whole class yourself.Since classes are objects, they must be generated by something.When you use the class keyword, Python creates this object automatically. But as\nwith most things in Python, it gives you a way to do it manually.Remember the function type? The good old function that lets you know what \ntype an object is:Well, type has a completely different ability, it can also create classes on the fly. type can take the description of a class as parameters, \nand return a class.(I  know, it\'s silly that the same function can have two completely different uses according to the parameters you pass to it. It\'s an issue due to backwards \ncompatibility in Python)type works this way:e.g.:can be created manually this way:You\'ll notice that we use "MyShinyClass" as the name of the class\nand as the variable to hold the class reference. They can be different,\nbut there is no reason to complicate things.type accepts a dictionary to define the attributes of the class. So:Can be translated to:And used as a normal class:And of course, you can inherit from it, so:would be:Eventually you\'ll want to add methods to your class. Just define a function\nwith the proper signature and assign it as an attribute.And you can add even more methods after you dynamically create the class, just like adding methods to a normally created class object.You see where we are going: in Python, classes are objects, and you can create a class on the fly, dynamically.This is what Python does when you use the keyword class, and it does so by using a metaclass.Metaclasses are the \'stuff\' that creates classes.You define classes in order to create objects, right?But we learned that Python classes are objects.Well, metaclasses are what create these objects. They are the classes\' classes,\nyou can picture them this way:You\'ve seen that type lets you do something like this:It\'s because the function type is in fact a metaclass. type is the \nmetaclass Python uses to create all classes behind the scenes.Now you wonder why the heck is it written in lowercase, and not Type?Well, I guess it\'s a matter of consistency with str, the class that creates\nstrings objects, and int the class that creates integer objects. type is\njust the class that creates class objects.You see that by checking the __class__ attribute. Everything, and I mean everything, is an object in Python. That includes ints, \nstrings, functions and classes. All of them are objects. And all of them have\nbeen created from a class:Now, what is the __class__ of any __class__ ?So, a metaclass is just the stuff that creates class objects.You can call it a \'class factory\' if you wish.type is the built-in metaclass Python uses, but of course, you can create your\nown metaclass.You can add a __metaclass__ attribute when you write a class:If you do so, Python will use the metaclass to create the class Foo.Careful, it\'s tricky.You write class Foo(object) first, but the class object Foo is not created\nin memory yet.Python will look for __metaclass__ in the class definition. If it finds it,\nit will use it to create the object class Foo. If it doesn\'t, it will use\ntype to create the class.Read that several times.When you do:Python does the following:Is there a __metaclass__ attribute in Foo?If yes, create in memory a class object (I said a class object, stay with me here), with the name Foo by using what is in __metaclass__.If Python can\'t find __metaclass__, it will look for a __metaclass__ at the MODULE level, and try to do the same (but only for classes that don\'t inherit anything, basically old-style classes). Then if it can\'t find any __metaclass__ at all, it will use the Bar\'s (the first parent) own metaclass (which might be the default type) to create the class object.Be careful here that the __metaclass__ attribute will not be inherited, the metaclass of the parent (Bar.__class__) will be. If Bar used a __metaclass__ attribute that created Bar with type() (and not type.__new__()), the subclasses will not inherit that behavior.Now the big question is, what can you put in __metaclass__ ?The answer is: something that can create a class.And what can create a class? type, or anything that subclasses or uses it.The main purpose of a metaclass is to change the class automatically,\nwhen it\'s created.You usually do this for APIs, where you want to create classes matching the\ncurrent context.Imagine a stupid example, where you decide that all classes in your module\nshould have their attributes written in uppercase. There are several ways to \ndo this, but one way is to set __metaclass__ at the module level.This way, all classes of this module will be created using this metaclass, \nand we just have to tell the metaclass to turn all attributes to uppercase.Luckily, __metaclass__ can actually be any callable, it doesn\'t need to be a\nformal class (I know, something with \'class\' in its name doesn\'t need to be \na class, go figure... but it\'s helpful).So we will start with a simple example, by using a function.Now, let\'s do exactly the same, but using a real class for a metaclass:But this is not really OOP. We call type directly and we don\'t override\nor call the parent __new__. Let\'s do it:You may have noticed the extra argument upperattr_metaclass. There is\nnothing special about it: __new__ always receives the class it\'s defined in, as first parameter. Just like you have self for ordinary methods which receive the instance as first parameter, or the defining class for class methods.Of course, the names I used here are long for the sake of clarity, but like\nfor self, all the arguments have conventional names. So a real production\nmetaclass would look like this:We can make it even cleaner by using super, which will ease inheritance (because yes, you can have metaclasses, inheriting from metaclasses, inheriting from type):That\'s it. There is really nothing more about metaclasses.The reason behind the complexity of the code using metaclasses is not because\nof metaclasses, it\'s because you usually use metaclasses to do twisted stuff\nrelying on introspection, manipulating inheritance, vars such as __dict__, etc.Indeed, metaclasses are especially useful to do black magic, and therefore\ncomplicated stuff. But by themselves, they are simple:Since __metaclass__ can accept any callable, why would you use a class\nsince it\'s obviously more complicated?There are several reasons to do so:Now the big question. Why would you use some obscure error prone feature?Well, usually you don\'t:Metaclasses are deeper magic that\n  99% of users should never worry about.\n  If you wonder whether you need them,\n  you don\'t (the people who actually\n  need them know with certainty that\n  they need them, and don\'t need an\n  explanation about why). Python Guru Tim PetersThe main use case for a metaclass is creating an API. A typical example of this is the Django ORM.It allows you to define something like this:But if you do this:It won\'t return an IntegerField object. It will return an int, and can even take it directly from the database.This is possible because models.Model defines __metaclass__ and \nit uses some magic that will turn the Person you just defined with simple statements\ninto a complex hook to a database field. Django makes something complex look simple by exposing a simple API\nand using metaclasses, recreating code from this API to do the real job\nbehind the scenes.First, you know that classes are objects that can create instances.Well in fact, classes are themselves instances. Of metaclasses.Everything is an object in Python, and they are all either instances of classes\nor instances of metaclasses.Except for type.type is actually its own metaclass. This is not something you could\nreproduce in pure Python, and is done by cheating a little bit at the implementation\nlevel.Secondly, metaclasses are complicated. You may not want to use them for \nvery simple class alterations. You can change classes by using two different techniques:99% of the time you need class alteration, you are better off using these.But 99% of the time, you don\'t need class alteration at all.Note, this answer is for Python 2.x as it was written in 2008, metaclasses are slightly different in 3.x, see the comments.Metaclasses are the secret sauce that make \'class\' work. The default metaclass for a new style object is called \'type\'.Metaclasses take 3 args. \'name\', \'bases\' and \'dict\'Here is where the secret starts. Look for where name, bases and the dict come from in this example class definition.Lets define a metaclass that will demonstrate how \'class:\' calls it.And now, an example that actually means something, this will automatically make the variables in the list "attributes" set on the class, and set to None.Note that the magic behaviour that \'Initalised\' gains by having the metaclass init_attributes is not passed onto a subclass of Initalised.Here is an even more concrete example, showing how you can subclass \'type\' to make a metaclass that performs an action when the class is created. This is quite tricky:One use for metaclasses is adding new properties and methods to an instance automatically.For example, if you look at Django models, their definition looks a bit confusing. It looks as if you are only defining class properties:However, at runtime the Person objects are filled with all sorts of useful methods. See the source for some amazing metaclassery.Others have explained how metaclasses work and how they fit into the Python type system. Here\'s an example of what they can be used for. In a testing framework I wrote, I wanted to keep track of the order in which classes were defined, so that I could later instantiate them in this order. I found it easiest to do this using a metaclass.Anything that\'s a subclass of MyType then gets a class attribute _order that records the order in which the classes were defined.I think the ONLamp introduction to metaclass programming is well written and gives a really good introduction to the topic despite being several years old already.http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2003/04/17/metaclasses.htmlIn short: A class is a blueprint for the creation of an instance, a metaclass is a blueprint for the creation of a class. It can be easily seen that in Python classes need to be first-class objects too to enable this behavior.I\'ve never written one myself, but I think one of the nicest uses of metaclasses can be seen in the Django framework. The model classes use a metaclass approach to enable a declarative style of writing new models or form classes. While the metaclass is creating the class, all members get the possibility to customize the class itself.The thing that\'s left to say is: If you don\'t know what metaclasses are, the probability that you will not need them is 99%.TLDR: A metaclass instantiates and defines behavior for a class just like a class instantiates and defines behavior for an instance. Pseudocode:The above should look familiar. Well, where does Class come from? It\'s an instance of a metaclass (also pseudocode):In real code, we can pass the default metaclass, type, everything we need to instantiate a class and we get a class:A class is to an instance as a metaclass is to a class. When we instantiate an object, we get an instance:Likewise, when we define a class explicitly with the default metaclass, type, we instantiate it:Put another way, a class is an instance of a metaclass:Put a third way, a metaclass is a class\'s class.When you write a class definition and Python executes it, it uses a metaclass to instantiate the class object (which will, in turn, be used to instantiate instances of that class).Just as we can use class definitions to change how custom object instances behave, we can use a metaclass class definition to change the way a class object behaves.What can they be used for? From the docs:The potential uses for metaclasses are boundless. Some ideas that have been explored include logging, interface checking, automatic delegation, automatic property creation, proxies, frameworks, and automatic resource locking/synchronization.Nevertheless, it is usually encouraged for users to avoid using metaclasses unless absolutely necessary.When you write a class definition, for example, like this,You instantiate a class object.It is the same as functionally calling type with the appropriate arguments and assigning the result to a variable of that name:Note, some things automatically get added to the __dict__, i.e., the namespace:The metaclass of the object we created, in both cases, is type. (A side-note on the contents of the class __dict__: __module__ is there because classes must know where they are defined, and  __dict__ and __weakref__ are there because we don\'t define __slots__ - if we define __slots__ we\'ll save a bit of space in the instances, as we can disallow __dict__ and __weakref__ by excluding them. For example:... but I digress.)Here\'s the default __repr__ of classes:One of the most valuable things we can do by default in writing a Python object is to provide it with a good __repr__. When we call help(repr) we learn that there\'s a good test for a __repr__ that also requires a test for equality - obj == eval(repr(obj)). The following simple implementation of __repr__ and __eq__ for class instances of our type class provides us with a demonstration that may improve on the default __repr__ of classes:So now when we create an object with this metaclass, the __repr__ echoed on the command line provides a much less ugly sight than the default:With a nice __repr__ defined for the class instance, we have a stronger ability to debug our code. However, much further checking with eval(repr(Class)) is unlikely (as functions would be rather impossible to eval from their default __repr__\'s).If, for example, we want to know in what order a class\'s methods are created in, we could provide an ordered dict as the namespace of the class. We would do this with __prepare__ which returns the namespace dict for the class if it is implemented in Python 3: And usage:And now we have a record of the order in which these methods (and other class attributes) were created:Note, this example was adapted from the documentation - the new enum in the standard library does this.So what we did was instantiate a metaclass by creating a class. We can also treat the metaclass as we would any other class. It has a method resolution order:And it has approximately the correct repr (which we can no longer eval unless we can find a way to represent our functions.):Python 3 updateThere are (at this point) two key methods in a metaclass:__prepare__ lets you supply a custom mapping (such as an OrderedDict) to be used as the namespace while the class is being created.  You must return an instance of whatever namespace you choose.  If you don\'t implement __prepare__ a normal dict is used.__new__ is responsible for the actual creation/modification of the final class.A bare-bones, do-nothing-extra metaclass would like:A simple example:Say you want some simple validation code to run on your attributes -- like it must always be an int or a str.  Without a metaclass, your class would look something like:As you can see, you have to repeat the name of the attribute twice.  This makes typos possible along with irritating bugs.A simple metaclass can address that problem:This is what the metaclass would look like (not using __prepare__ since it is not needed):A sample run of:produces:Note:  This example is simple enough it could have also been accomplished with a class decorator, but presumably an actual metaclass would be doing much more.The \'ValidateType\' class for reference:A metaclass is a class that tells how (some) other class should be created.This is a case where I saw metaclass as a solution to my problem:\nI had a really complicated problem, that probably could have been solved differently, but I chose to solve it using a metaclass.  Because of the complexity, it is one of the few modules I have written where the comments in the module surpass the amount of code that has been written.  Here it is...If you\'ve done Python programming for more than a few months you\'ll eventually stumble upon code that looks like this:The latter is possible when you implement the __call__() magic method on the class.The __call__() method is invoked when an instance of a class is used as a callable. But as we\'ve seen from previous answers a class itself is an instance of a metaclass, so when we use the class as a callable (i.e. when we create an instance of it) we\'re actually calling its metaclass\'s __call__() method. At this point most Python programmers are a bit confused because they\'ve been told that when creating an instance like this instance = SomeClass() you\'re calling it\'s __init__() method. Some who\'ve dug a bit deeper know that before __init__() there\'s __new__(). Well, today another layer of truth is being revealed, before __new__() there\'s the metaclass\'s __call__().Let\'s study the method call chain from specifically the perspective of creating an instance of a class.This is a metaclass that logs exactly the moment before an instance is created and the moment it\'s about to return it.This is a class that uses that metaclass And now let\'s create an instance of Class_1The code above doesn\'t actually do anything other than logging the task and then delegating the actual work to the parent (i.e. keeping the default behavior). So with type being Meta_1\'s parent class, we can imagine that this would be the pseudo implementation of type.__call__():We can see that the metaclass\'s __call__() method is the one that\'s called first. It then delegates creation of the instance to the class\'s __new__() method and initialization to the instance\'s __init__(). It\'s also the one that ultimately returns the instance.From the above it stems that the metaclass\'s __call__() is also given the opportunity to decide whether or not a call to Class_1.__new__() or Class_1.__init__() will eventually be made. Over the course of its execution it could actually return an object that hasn\'t been touched by either of these methods. Take for example this approach to the singleton pattern:Let\'s observe what happens when repeatedly trying to create an object of type Class_2type is actually a metaclass -- a class that creates another classes.\nMost metaclass are the subclasses of type. The metaclass receives the new class as its first argument and provide access to class object with details as mentioned below:Note:Notice that the class was not instantiated at any time; the simple act of creating the class triggered execution of the metaclass.The type(obj) function gets you the type of an object. The type() of a class is its metaclass.To use a metaclass:Python classes are themselves objects - as in instance - of their meta-class. The default metaclass, which is applied when when you determine classes as:meta class are used to apply some rule to an entire set of classes. For example, suppose you\'re building an ORM to access a database, and you want records from each table to be of a class mapped to that table (based on fields, business rules, etc..,), a possible use of metaclass is for instance, connection pool logic, which is share by all classes of record from all tables. Another use is logic to to support foreign keys, which involves multiple classes of records. when you define metaclass, you subclass type, and can overrided the following magic methods to insert your logic. anyhow, those two are the most commonly used hooks. metaclassing is powerful, and above is nowhere near and exhaustive list of uses for metaclassing. A metaclass is essentially an abstract base class--a concept taught in most intermediate computer programming courses.
