What is __init__.py for in a Python source directory?It\'s a part of a package. Here\'s the documentation.The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later (deeper) on the module search path. In the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__ variable, described later.Files named __init__.py are used to mark directories on disk as Python package directories.\nIf you have the filesand mydir is on your path, you can import the code in module.py asor If you remove the __init__.py file, Python will no longer look for submodules inside that directory, so attempts to import the module will fail.The __init__.py file is usually empty, but can be used to export selected portions of the package under more convenient name, hold convenience functions, etc.\nGiven the example above, the contents of the init module can be accessed as based on thisIn addition to labeling a directory as a Python package and defining __all__, __init__.py allows you to define any variable at the package level. Doing so is often convenient if a package defines something that will be imported frequently, in an API-like fashion. This pattern promotes adherence to the Pythonic "flat is better than nested" philosophy.Here is an example from one of my projects, in which I frequently import a sessionmaker called Session to interact with my database. I wrote a "database" package with a few modules:My __init__.py contains the following code:Since I define Session here, I can start a new session using the syntax below. This code would be the same executed from inside or outside of the "database" package directory.Of course, this is a small convenience -- the alternative would be to define Session in a new file like "create_session.py" in my database package, and start new sessions using:There is a pretty interesting reddit thread covering appropriate uses of __init__.py here:http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1bbbwk/whats_your_opinion_on_what_to_include_in_init_py/The majority opinion seems to be that __init__.py files should be very thin to avoid violating the "explicit is better than implicit" philosophy.The __init__.py file makes Python treat directories containing it as modules. Furthermore, this is the first file to be loaded in a module, so you can use it to execute code that you want to run each time a module is loaded, or specify the submodules to be exported.There are 2 main reasons for __init__.pyFor convenience: the other users will not need to know your functions\' exact location in your package hierarchy.then others can call add() by without knowing file1, likeIf you want something to be initialized; for example, logging (which should be put in the top level):In Python the definition of package is very simple. Like Java the hierarchical structure and the directory structure are the same. But you have to have __init__.py in a package. I will explain the __init__.py file with the example below:__init__.py can be empty, as long as it exists. It indicates that the directory should be regarded as a package. Of course, __init__.py can also set the appropriate content.If we add a function in module_n1:After running:Then we followed the hierarchy package and called module_n1 the function. We can use __init__.py in subPackage_b like this:After running: Hence using * importing, module package is subject to __init__.py content.__init__.py will treat the directory it is in as a loadable module.For people who prefer reading code, I put Two-Bit Alchemist\'s comment here.Since Python 3.3, __init__.py is no longer required to define directories as importable Python packages.Check PEP 420: Implicit Namespace Packages:Native support for package directories that don\xe2\x80\x99t require __init__.py marker files and can automatically span multiple path segments (inspired by various third party approaches to namespace packages, as described in PEP 420)Here\'s the test:  references:\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html#pep-420-implicit-namespace-packages\nhttps://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420/\nIs __init__.py not required for packages in Python 3? It facilitates importing other python files. When you placed this file in a directory (say stuff)containing other py files, then you can do something like import stuff.other.Without this __init__.py inside the directory stuff, you couldn\'t import other.py, because Python doesn\'t know where the source code for stuff is and unable to recognize it as a package.
