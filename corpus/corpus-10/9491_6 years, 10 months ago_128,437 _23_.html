I\'m trying to get the name of the Python script that is currently running.For example, I have a script called foo.py and I would like to do something like this inside it:and get: foo.py.Use __file__.  If you want to omit the directory part (which might be present), you can use os.path.basename(__file__).This will print foo.py for python foo.py, dir/foo.py for python dir/foo.py, etc. It\'s the first argument to python. (Note that after py2exe it would be foo.exe.)Note that __file__ will give the file where this code resides, which can be imported and different from the main file being interpreted. To get the main file, the special __main__ module can be used:Note that __main__.__file__ works in Python 2.7 but not in 3.2, so use the import-as syntax as above to make it portable.The Above answers are good . But I found this method more efficient using above results.\nThis results in actual script file name not a path.For completeness\' sake, I thought it would be worthwhile summarizing the various possible outcomes and supplying references for the exact behaviour of each:__file__ is the currently executing file, as detailed in the official documentation:__file__ is the pathname of the file from which the module was loaded, if it was loaded from a file. The __file__ attribute may be missing for certain types of modules, such as C modules that are statically linked into the interpreter; for extension modules loaded dynamically from a shared library, it is the pathname of the shared library file.From Python3.4 onwards, per issue 18416, __file__ is always an absolute path, unless the currently executing file is a script that has been executed directly (not via the interpreter with the -m command line option) using a relative path.__main__.__file__ (requires importing __main__) simply accesses the aforementioned __file__ attribute of the main module, e.g. of the script that was invoked from the command line.sys.argv[0] (requires importing sys) is the script name that was invoked from the command line, and might be an absolute path, as detailed in the official documentation:argv[0] is the script name (it is operating system dependent whether this is a full pathname or not). If the command was executed using the -c command line option to the interpreter, argv[0] is set to the string \'-c\'. If no script name was passed to the Python interpreter, argv[0] is the empty string.As mentioned in another answer to this question, Python scripts that were converted into stand-alone executable programs via tools such as py2exe or PyInstaller might not display the desired result when using this approach (i.e. sys.argv[0] would hold the name of the executable rather than the name of the main Python file within that executable).os.path.basename() may be invoked on any of the above in order to extract the actual file name.Try this:The first argument in sys will be the current file name so this will workAssuming the script is called foo.pywill printbut,will print
