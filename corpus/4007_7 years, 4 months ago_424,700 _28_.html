This question already has an answer here:I\'m trying to rename some files in a directory using Python.Say I have a file called CHEESE_CHEESE_TYPE.*** and want to remove CHEESE_ so my resulting filename would be CHEESE_TYPEI\'m trying to use the os.path.split but it\'s not working properly. I have also considered using string manipulations, but have not been successful with that either.Use os.rename(src, dst) to rename or move a file or a directory.Here\'s a script based on your newest comment.The following code should work. It takes every filename in the current directory, if the filename contains the pattern CHEESE_CHEESE_ then it is renamed. If not nothing is done to the filename.Assuming you are already in the directory, and that the "first 8 characters" from your comment hold true always.  (Although "CHEESE_" is 7 characters... ? If so, change the 8 below to 7)Try this:I\'m assuming you don\'t want to remove the file extension, but you can just do the same split with periods.I have the same issue, where I want to replace the white space  in any pdf file to a dash -.\nBut the files were in multiple sub-directories. So, I had to use os.walk().\nIn your case for multiple sub-directories, it could be something like this:This sort of stuff is perfectly fitted for IPython, which has shell integration.Note: to store this in a script, use the .ipy extension, and prefix all shell commands with !.See also: http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/interactive/shell.htmlIt seems that your problem is more in determining the new file name rather than the rename itself (for which you could use the os.rename method).It is not clear from your question what the pattern is that you want to be renaming. There is nothing wrong with string manipulation. A regular expression may be what you need here.this command will remove the initial "CHEESE_" string from all the files in the current directory, using renamer:Here is a more general solution:This code can be used to remove any particular character or set of characters recursively from all filenames within a directory and replace them with any other character, set of characters or no character.You can use os.system function for simplicity and to invoke bash to accomplish the task:I was originally looking for some GUI which would allow renaming using regular expressions and which had a preview of the result before applying changes.On Linux I have successfully used krename, on Windows Total Commander does renaming with regexes, but I found no decent free equivalent for OSX, so I ended up writing a python script which works recursively and by default only prints the new file names without making any changes. Add the \'-w\' switch to actually modify the file names.I want to flip parts of a file name in the following manner, i.e. move the bit m7-08 to the beginning of the file name:This will perform a dry run, and print the new file names without actually renaming any files:This will do the actual renaming (you can use either -w or --write):import os\nimport string\ndef rename_files():rename_files()This works for me.
